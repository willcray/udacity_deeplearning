# Udacity Deep Learning Assignments
This course bolstered my understanding of the two online Machine Learning courses I had previously taken, and it also extended my knowledge of AI into Deep Learning/Neural Nets and Conovlutional Neural Nets. I used this course as a tool to give me the background knowledge needed to work on some image recognition project ideas.
